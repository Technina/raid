# Rogue AI Dungeon

A Rogue-like game based on the [battlecode](http://battlecode.org) API. We hope this game will be fun and help people prepare to compete in battlecode!

Check out the [latest version](http://bovard.github.io/raid/)!

We're going to program this during the 2016 [7DRL](http://7drl.org/) challenge. 


We'll do the work in two phases.

### Phase 1: Pre-7DRL (create and vet the API)

1. re-create the battlecode api (before 7DRL begins)
2. create a prototype using it 	(before 7DRL begins)

### Phase 2: During 7DRL (Create the game!)

1. create a rich UI
2. create and balance the game concept/rules
3. create and balance levels
4. create leaderboard

We believe this is in the [spirit](http://forums.roguetemple.com/index.php?topic=4885.0) of the 7DRL challenge.
